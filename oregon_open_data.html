<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Accessing Oregon Open Data from R</h1>
<h4 class="author">Antonio R. Vargas</h4>

</div>


<p>The <a href="https://github.com/Chicago/RSocrata">RSocrata</a>
package makes it easy to pull data from <a
href="https://data.oregon.gov/">data.oregon.gov</a> directly into R.</p>
<p>Here are the packages we’ll use in the examples:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">library</span>(dplyr)</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">library</span>(stringr)</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">library</span>(janitor)</span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">library</span>(RSocrata)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Suppose you’ve already used the search engine on <a
href="https://data.oregon.gov/">data.oregon.gov</a> and decided you want
the data on <a
href="https://data.oregon.gov/business/New-Businesses-Registered-Last-Month/esjy-u4fc">new
businesses registered last month</a>. Since you already know the URL,
you can just pass that to <code>RSocrata::read.socrata()</code> to pull
that data set into R:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" tabindex="-1"></a>new_businesses <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">read.socrata</span>(<span class="st">&quot;https://data.oregon.gov/business/New-Businesses-Registered-Last-Month/esjy-u4fc&quot;</span>)</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3" tabindex="-1"></a>new_businesses <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span> </span>
<span id="cb2-4"><a href="#cb2-4" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="fu">head</span>(<span class="dv">30</span>)</span></code></pre></div>

A nursing home traditionally offers 24-hour (skilled) nursing to the elderly or to disabled patients having a variety of medical conditions who require personal care services above that of an assisted living but do not require hospitalization. The personal care services provided may or may not include, but are not limited to: skilled nursing, long term inpatient care, room and board, meals, laundry, and assistance with: dressing, grooming, getting in and out of bed, medications, bathing, and toileting. \\n\\nFor purposes of this dataset, an assisted living facility is defined as a facility where the elderly, who are not related to the operator, reside and receive care, treatment, or services. Although not at the level of a nursing home, the services are above the level of an independent living community. They may include several hours per week of supportive care, personal care, or nursing care per resident. Generally, an assisted living facility offers help in daily living (laundry, cooking, cleaning, etc.) and personal assistance (bathing, eating, clothing, etc.). Many assisted living facilities offer assistance with medication and a lesser level of nursing care than what is offered at a nursing home. \\n\\nAssisted living facilities may be regulated by size restrictions depending on which type of assisted living facility it is considered to be in the state in which it exists. For example, Adult Family Homes in Wisconsin have between 3-4 elderly residents while Community Based Residential Facilities have 5 or more. Almost every state has different terminology to describe their version of the assisted living facility system. \\n\\nThe structures in which assisted living facilities exist are varied as well. Depending on the type, an assisted living facility may operate out of a personal residence or a nursing home style structure, and it may be set up as apartment style living or as a campus setting in a continuing care retirement community. Multiple assisted living facilities may exist at one location or may be co-located with nursing homes and/or other similar health care facilities. \\n\\nIf a facility is licensed by a state and holds multiple licenses, it is represented once in this dataset for each license, even if the licenses are for the same location. \\n\\nThis dataset does not include retirement communities, adult daycare facilities, or rehabilitation facilities. Nursing Homes that are operated by and co-located with a hospital are also excluded because the locations are included in the hospital dataset. \\n\\nRecords with \"-DOD\" appended to the end of the [NAME] value are located on a military base, as defined by the Defense Installation Spatial Data Infrastructure (DISDI) military installations and military range boundaries. \\n\\n\"#\" and \"*\" characters were automatically removed from standard fields populated by TechniGraphics. Double spaces were replaced by single spaces in these same fields. \\n\\nText fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results. \\n\\nAll diacritics (e.g., the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use with database systems that may not support diacritics. \\n\\nThe currentness of this dataset is indicated by the [CONTDATE] field. Based on this field, the oldest record dates from 09/22/2009 and the newest record dates from 12/17/2009.","10":"Nursing Homes","11":"<NULL>","12":"<NULL>","13":"NA","14":"NULL","15":"NA","_rn_":"176"},{"1":"public","2":"https://data.oregon.gov/d/bdue-a8un","3":"2016-10-13","4":"dcat:Dataset","5":"2016-10-13","6":"<df[,3] [503 × 3]>","7":"https://data.oregon.gov/api/views/bdue-a8un","8":"<df[,2] [503 × 2]>","9":"","10":"Prioritization Log","11":"<df[,5] [4 × 5]>","12":"<NULL>","13":"NA","14":"NULL","15":"NA","_rn_":"177"},{"1":"public","2":"https://data.oregon.gov/d/bgs4-pj98","3":"2015-03-23","4":"dcat:Dataset","5":"2015-12-22","6":"<df[,3] [503 × 3]>","7":"https://data.oregon.gov/api/views/bgs4-pj98","8":"<df[,2] [503 × 2]>","9":"","10":"Developers Featured Content","11":"<df[,5] [4 × 5]>","12":"<NULL>","13":"NA","14":"NULL","15":"NA","_rn_":"178"},{"1":"public","2":"https://data.oregon.gov/d/bhpi-5fnr","3":"2019-07-03","4":"dcat:Dataset","5":"2019-07-03","6":"<df[,3] [503 × 3]>","7":"https://data.oregon.gov/api/views/bhpi-5fnr","8":"<df[,2] [503 × 2]>","9":"","10":"Healthcare Worker Influenza Vaccination Data for Ambulatory Surgery Centers, 2017 - 2018","11":"<df[,5] [4 × 5]>","12":"<NULL>","13":"NA","14":"NULL","15":"NA","_rn_":"179"},{"1":"public","2":"https://data.oregon.gov/d/bmea-5dun","3":"2012-04-13","4":"dcat:Dataset","5":"2022-10-17","6":"<df[,3] [503 × 3]>","7":"https://data.oregon.gov/api/views/bmea-5dun","8":"<df[,2] [503 × 2]>","9":"","10":"Bills Signed by Governor Kitzhaber (2012)","11":"<df[,5] [4 × 5]>","12":"<chr [8]>","13":"https://www.usa.gov/government-works","14":"Administrative","15":"NA","_rn_":"180"},{"1":"public","2":"https://data.oregon.gov/d/btwj-27et","3":"2018-06-06","4":"dcat:Dataset","5":"2023-03-01","6":"<df[,3] [503 × 3]>","7":"https://data.oregon.gov/api/views/btwj-27et","8":"<df[,2] [503 × 2]>","9":"Codes in this group are not on the Prioritized List.

The data is presented in the Department of Consumer and Business Services report at https://www.oregon.gov/dcbs/reports/compensation/Pages/index.aspx. The attached pdf provides definitions of the data.\\n\\nWorkers’ compensation indemnity benefits are cash benefits paid to injured workers. These benefits include benefits for temporary disability (time loss), permanent partial disability, permanent total disability, and death. Statute sets eligibility criteria and the rates at which insurers pay these benefits. In the case of death from work-related causes, indemnity benefits are paid to survivors. Indemnity benefits also include vocational assistance benefits paid on behalf of severely disabled workers to get them back to work.\\n\\nIndemnity benefits also include settlements between workers and insurers. Claim disposition agreements (CDAs) and disputed claim settlements (DCSs) are the two forms of settlements.\\n\\nThe Workers' Benefit Fund ( WBF)provides funds for programs that assist employers and injured workers. Assessment revenues, not insurance premiums, finance these programs. Employers and workers each pay half the assessment. The two major programs are the Retroactive Program and the Re-employment Assistance Program.\\n\\nThe Retroactive Program pays cost-of-living increases to workers or their beneficiaries based on changes in average wages. The two major benefits paid are for permanent total disability and death. Since at least 1995, the majority of PTD and death benefits have been paid from this program.\\n\\nThe Re-employment Assistance Program provides incentives for injured workers to return to work, through the Employer-at-Injury Program (EAIP) and the Preferred Worker Program (PWP). Benefits common to both are wage subsidies, worksite modifications, and employment purchases.\\n\\nWorkers who have not been released to regular work but can return to transitional jobs are eligible for the EAIP. Use of this program allows many claims to remain nondisabling even though the workers have medical restrictions.\\n\\nWorkers who have a permanent disability and are unable to return to regular work are eligible for the PWP benefits, which may be initiated by either the worker or the employer. In addition, claim cost reimbursement is paid for preferred workers who suffer new injuries.\\n\\nThe data in this table include estimated figures and are subject to revision. All dollars are shown in millions of dollars.","10":"Workers' Compensation Indemnity Benefits Data","11":"<df[,5] [4 × 5]>","12":"<chr [14]>","13":"NA","14":"business","15":"NA","_rn_":"192"},{"1":"public","2":"https://data.oregon.gov/d/ccbz-8fft","3":"2016-08-31","4":"dcat:Dataset","5":"2016-08-31","6":"<df[,3] [503 × 3]>","7":"https://data.oregon.gov/api/views/ccbz-8fft","8":"<df[,2] [503 × 2]>","9":"","10":"Region 4 Combined Fix-it Enhance 100% List - 2018-2021 STIP","11":"<df[,5] [4 × 5]>","12":"<NULL>","13":"NA","14":"Transportation","15":"NA","_rn_":"193"},{"1":"public","2":"https://data.oregon.gov/d/cdnv-r4ea","3":"2020-11-16","4":"dcat:Dataset","5":"2022-10-10","6":"<df[,3] [503 × 3]>","7":"https://data.oregon.gov/api/views/cdnv-r4ea","8":"<df[,2] [503 × 2]>","9":"The Oregon State legislature passed House Bill (HB) 2066 in 2017.

The average awards include the initial awards made by insurers and the net amounts awarded during the appeal process.

Prior to 2005, the benefits were based on statutory lists of scheduled and unscheduled body parts. For claims with injuries since 1/1/2005, the permanent impairment of all body parts and systems is rated in relation to the whole person. The benefit is based on the statewide average weekly wage multiplied by the percentage of impairment.

<p>This can be helpful if you’re an advanced user and want to run a
custom search that is difficult with the web interface.</p>
<p>For example, we could write a search that uses a simple regular
expression to find all data sets whose title, description, or keywords
contain any of the following tokens:</p>
<ul>
<li>birth</li>
<li>natal</li>
<li>matern</li>
<li>midwife</li>
<li>women</li>
<li>woman</li>
<li>female</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the <code>keyword</code> column is a list column, where
each row is a character vector. So we’ll have to carefully loop through
each vector in the list.</p>
