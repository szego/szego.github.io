    <h2>Homelessness in Oregon Public School Districts</h2>
    <h3>Proportion of the student body navigating homelessness in the 2018-2019 school year<br>
    </h3>
    This map shows, for each public school district in Oregon, the percent of
    students reported to be navigating homelessness during the 2018-2019 school year. Here, "navigating homelessness" refers to students in K-12 public schools and children ages 3 to 5 in public preschool programs who lack a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence during the academic year. Each school districtâ€™s Homeless Liaison identifies and annually reports information on homeless children and youth to ODE. You can
    read more about student homelessness and access the data used to make these maps on the Department of Education's <a
href="https://www.oregon.gov/ode/schools-and-districts/grants/ESEA/McKinney-Vento/Pages/default.aspx">webpage for the McKinney-Vento Act</a>.<br>

    <br>
    This map combines the data from ODE with <a
            href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/Geographic/DistrictBoundaries">spatial data for school district boundaries from the NCES</a>.<br>
        <h3>How was this map created?</h3>
        <p>I made this map using the R programming language. <a href="homelessness_map_writeup.html">Click here</a> to read my writeup of the process. The writeup fully details how to obtain the raw data and includes complete, reusable source code for making other maps like this one.<br>

        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p>I was inspired to make this after reading Natalie Pate's 21 November, 2019 article in the Statesman Journal:</p>
        <p><b><a href="https://www.statesmanjournal.com/story/news/education/2019/11/21/more-oregon-students-experiencing-homelessness-report-shows-salem/4262993002/">Oregon students experiencing homelessness on the rise again, report shows</a></b><br><br></p>
