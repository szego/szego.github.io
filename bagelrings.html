calculating a "Mathematically Correct Breakfast"</font><br>

<br>

A friend of mine recently sent me a link to this video by George W.
Hart in
which he cuts a bagel into two interlocking rings.<br>

<br>

<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dN8AwGUaqDA?rel=0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="390" width="640"></iframe></div>

<br>

After toasting the bagel rings George wonders about how much surface
area he has available for cream cheese. &nbsp;Is there more or less
compared to the usual method of just slicing the bagel straight in half?<br>

<br>

To answer this question we first need to visualize exactly how George
is cutting the bagel. &nbsp;Let's assume the bagel is perfectly
round -- let's assume it's a torus, to be precise. &nbsp;We'll also
assume he's cutting the bagel perfectly evenly. &nbsp;If we looked
closely, we'd find that he's
actually cutting the bagel in half along a two-twist Möbius strip.
&nbsp;This
cut is shown in the image below.<br>

<br>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 550px; height: 350px;" alt="The mobius strip cut into the bagel" src="bagelrings_pics/mobius.png"></div>

<br>

<font style="font-family: Times New Roman;" size="+2">
Calculating the area of the two-twist Möbius strip</font><br>

<br>

We'll need some equations to describe the bagel. &nbsp;The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus#Geometry">Wikipedia
article for the torus</a> provides us with a parameterization,
given by<br>

\[
\begin{align*}
&amp; x = (R + r\cos \varphi) \cos \theta \\
&amp; y = (R + r\cos \varphi) \sin \theta \\
&amp; z = r \sin \varphi,
\end{align*}
\]
where $R$ is the distance from the center of the torus to the center of
the tube and $r$ is the radius of the tube. Each point on the torus
$(x,y,z)$ is represented by a single combination of the parameters
$\theta$ and $\varphi$, each of which lie between $0$ to $2\pi$.
&nbsp;In order for this to represent a physical bagel we can't
allow any self-intersections, so we'll also require the diameter of the
tube to be less than half the diameter of the torus, which is the same
as requiring $0 &lt; r \leq R$.<br>

<br>

Using this parameterization for the torus we can obtain a
parameterization for the möbius strip inside it. &nbsp;In the
formula above we'll replace $r$ with $\rho$ and let $\rho$ to vary from
$-r$ to $r$, allowing us to cross from one side of the tube to the
other through its center. &nbsp;Furthermore, the cut completes a
full twist before returning to its starting point, so to capture this
we'll also set $\varphi = \theta$.<br>

<br>

The (vector form) parameterization of the two-twist Möbius strip is
thus
\[
\gamma(\rho,\theta) = \Bigl\langle (R + \rho \cos\theta) \cos\theta,\
(R + \rho \cos\theta) \sin\theta,\ \rho \sin\theta \Bigr\rangle.
\]
Wikipedia provides us with the formula to calculate the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_surface#Surface_area">surface
area of
a parameterized surface</a>, and in our case we can express the
surface area of the two-twist Möbius strip as
\[
A_\text{Möb}(R,r) = \int_0^{2\pi} \!\int_{-r}^r
\,\left|\frac{\partial\gamma}{\partial\rho} \times
\frac{\partial\gamma}{\partial\theta}
\right|\,d\rho d\theta.
\]
After some work we calculate
\[
\left|\frac{\partial\gamma}{\partial\rho} \times
\frac{\partial\gamma}{\partial\theta}
\right|^2 = R^2 + 2R\rho\cos\theta + \frac{1}{2} \rho^2 (3 + \cos
2\theta),
\]
so that
\[
A_\text{Möb}(R,r) = \int_0^{2\pi} \!\int_{-r}^r
\,\sqrt{R^2 + 2R\rho\cos\theta + \frac{1}{2} \rho^2 (3 + \cos
2\theta)}
\,d\rho d\theta. \tag{1}
\]
This integral we've arrived at seems fairly intractable (Mathematica
throws up its hands in frustration) but there is still much we can
learn from it.<br>

<br>

<font style="font-family: Times New Roman;" size="+2">How
much more surface area can we get?</font><br>

<br>

If you recall, our goal in all this is to compare the amount of cream
cheeseable surface area revealed by cutting along the two-twist Möbius
strip to the amount revealed by cutting the bagel straight in half.
&nbsp;We've obtained an expression for the former amount, and of
course we'll need to calculate the latter amount as well.
&nbsp;Luckily this task is much simpler than the work we did above.<br>

<br>

The surface exposed by cutting a bagel straight in half is a disk with
a hole in the center. &nbsp;In the notation from the previous
section, the outer ring of the disk has radius $R+r$ and the inner ring
has radius $R - r$, so all together the surface area is the difference
of the areas of these two circles,
\[
A_\text{flat}(R,r) = \pi(R+r)^2 - \pi(R-r)^2 = 4\pi Rr.
\]
We can now write down the ratio of these two surface areas. Using the
expression from equaiton $(1)$ we have
\[
\begin{align*}
\frac{A_\text{Möb}(R,r)}{A_\text{flat}(R,r)} &amp;= \frac{1}{4\pi
Rr}
\int_0^{2\pi} \!\int_{-r}^r\,\sqrt{R^2 + 2R\rho\cos\theta + \frac{1}{2}
\rho^2 (3 + \cos 2\theta)} \,d\rho d\theta \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{4\pi r} \int_0^{2\pi} \!\int_{-r}^r\,\sqrt{1 +
2\frac{\rho}{R}\cos\theta + \frac{1}{2}
\frac{\rho^2}{R^2} (3 + \cos 2\theta)} \,d\rho d\theta \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{4\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} \!\int_{-1}^1\,\sqrt{1 +
2\frac{r}{R}\sigma\cos\theta + \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{r}{R}\right)^2
\sigma^2 (3 + \cos 2\theta)} \,d\sigma d\theta \tag{2},
\end{align*}
\]
where in the second line we factored an $R$ out of the square root and
in the third line we made the change of variables $\rho = r\sigma$ in
the inner integral.
<br>

<br>

This expression is quite interesting. For starters it tells
us the following fact.<br>

<br>

<div id="outer">
<div id="inner2"><b>Proposition 1.</b>
The ratio of the surface areas
$A_\text{Möb}(R,r)/A_\text{flat}(R,r)$ depends only on the ratio of the
radii $r/R$.
</div>
</div>

<br>

In particular, as long as the ratio $r/R$ is held constant, it doesn't
matter how big the bagel is, the ratio of the surface areas will
not change.
<br>

<br>

Now, if we let $t = r/R$ then we can define a new function $f$
by
\[
f(t) = \frac{A_\text{Möb}(R,r)}{A_\text{flat}(R,r)} = \frac{1}{4\pi}
\int_0^{2\pi} \!\int_{-1}^1\,\sqrt{1 +
2t\sigma\cos\theta + \frac{1}{2} t^2
\sigma^2 (3 + \cos 2\theta)} \,d\sigma d\theta. \tag{3}
\]
Below is a plot of $f(t)$. Since $0 &lt; r \leq R$ our new
parameter $t$ ranges from $0$ to $1$.<br>

<br>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 500px; height: 319px;" alt="plot of the function f(t)" src="bagelrings_pics/fplot.png"></div>

<br>

From this plot it certainly looks like $f(t)$ is an increasing
function, so let's try to prove this. We begin by calculating
\[
f'(t) = \frac{1}{4\pi}
\int_0^{2\pi} \!\int_{-1}^1\,\frac{2\sigma\cos\theta + t\sigma^2 (3 +
\cos 2\theta)}{2\sqrt{1 +
2t\sigma\cos\theta + \frac{1}{2} t^2
\sigma^2 (3 + \cos 2\theta)}} \,d\sigma d\theta.
\]
From this we find that $f'(0) = 0$, so if we can prove that $f''(t)
&gt; 0$ we'll be able to conclude that $f'(t) &gt; 0$
for $t &gt; 0$. Indeed,
\[
f''(t) = \frac{1}{4\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} \!\int_{-1}^1\,
\frac{\sigma^2}{\left( 1 + 2t\sigma\cos\theta + \frac{1}{2}t^2\sigma^2
(3+\cos 2\theta)\right)^{3/2}} \,d\sigma d\theta,
\]
and since the integrand is nonnegative and not identically zero we may
conclude that $f''(t) &gt; 0$ for all $t$. As stated above, this
implies that $f(t)$ is strictly increasing in $t$.
<br>

<br>

From this we conclude the following fact.
<br>

<br>

<div id="outer">
<div id="inner2"><b>Proposition 2.</b>
The ratio of the surface areas $A_\text{Möb}(R,r)/A_\text{flat}(R,r)$
is a strictly increasing function of $r/R$. Since $0 &lt; r \leq R$
we have
\[
1 &lt; \frac{A_\text{Möb}(R,r)}{A_\text{flat}(R,r)} \leq
\frac{A_\text{Möb}(1,1)}{A_\text{flat}(1,1)} \approx 1.1739\ 7932\
4030.
\]
</div>
</div>

<br>

In essence what this says is that, for a given size of bagel, cutting
the bagel along the two-twist Möbius strip yields the largest gains in
surface area when the hole in the center of the bagel is the smallest.
&nbsp; The maximum amount that the surface area can increase when
compared with cutting the bagel straight in half is about $17.4\%$.<br>

<br>

The amount that the surface area can increase will be less than this
for most bagels. &nbsp;For example, for a bagel $2$ inches thick
and $5$ inches wide, cutting along the two-twist Möbius strip yields an
increase in cream cheesable surface area of about $7.72\%$.
&nbsp;Depending on how much you enjoy cream cheese this may or may
not be worth it.<br>

<br>

<font style="font-family: Times New Roman;" size="+2">Approximating
the ratio of the surface areas</font><br>

<br>

If we're in the middle of making breakfast then we don't really have
time to start up our computer just to evaluate the integral in equation
$(2)$. What would be really handy is an accurate approximation. And
really, the assumption that our bagels are perfect torii is already an
approximation, so we shouldn't feel too bad about the loss of accuracy.<br>

<br>

In this problem the path to an approximation is delightfully short. In
the definition of the function $f(t)$ in equation $(3)$
the parameter $t$ lies between $0$ and $1$, and in the integrand it is
multiplied by bounded functions, so it seems appropriate to expand the
integrand in Taylor series about the point $t=0$. We find that
\[
\sqrt{1 + 2t\sigma\cos\theta + \frac{1}{2} t^2 \sigma^2 (3 + \cos
2\theta)} = 1 + t\sigma\cos\theta + \frac{1}{2}t^2\sigma^2 +
O\left(t^3\right),
\]
and if we replace the integrand by these first three terms of its
Taylor series we obtain the approximation
\[
\begin{align}
\frac{A_\text{Möb}(R,r)}{A_\text{flat}(R,r)} &amp;\approx
\frac{1}{4\pi}
\int_0^{2\pi} \!\int_{-1}^1\, 1 + t\sigma\cos\theta +
\frac{1}{2}t^2\sigma^2 \,d\sigma d\theta \\
&amp;= 1 + \frac{1}{6}t^2 \\
&amp;= 1 + \frac{1}{6} \left(\frac{r}{R}\right)^2.
\end{align}
\]
This approximation produces reasonably good results. It's most accurate
when the ratio $r/R$ is small.<br>

<br>

Some might say that measuring $R$ and $r$ quickly isn't as easy as just
measuring
the width and the height of the bagel. Of course we can
express these quantities in terms of the others as
\[
R = \frac{\text{width} - \text{height}}{2}
\]
and
\[
r = \frac{\text{height}}{2},
\]
so we'll conclude the page with the following statement for practical
use.
<br>

<br>

<div id="outer">
<div id="inner2"><b>Proposition 3.</b>
The ratio of the surface area exposed by
cutting along the two-twist Möbius strip to the area exposed by cutting
the bagel straight in half is approximately
\[
1 + \frac{1}{6} \left(\frac{\text{height}}{\text{width} -
\text{height}}\right)^2.
