    <h2>Math and English Language Arts Proficiency in Oregon Public
      Schools</h2>
    <h3>Statewide assessment results from the 2018-2019 school year<br>
    </h3>
    These maps show, for each public school in Oregon, the percent of
    students scoring at or above proficiency on the statewide
    assessments administered during the 2018-2019 school year. You can
    read more about the statewide assessments <a
href="https://www.oregon.gov/ode/educator-resources/assessment/Pages/Statewide-Assessments.aspx">on

      the Department of Education's website</a>.<br>

        maps in full resolution." width="900" height="343" border="0"></a><br>
    <br>
    In these maps a polygon is drawn around each school building and
    colored according to the proportion its students who scored at or
    above "proficiency" on the assessments. These polygons form a <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram">Voronoi
      diagram</a> of Oregon's public schools.<br>
    <h4>High resolution versions of these maps</h4>
    <p>Click on the images below to see high resolution versions of the
      maps. These allow you to zoom in and see more detail in densely
      populated areas of the state.<br>

    <p>The full resolution maps are each about 3.5 MB in size.<br>

        These maps combine data from ODE (proficiency data), NCES
        (school coordinates), ODOT (locations of highways, freeways, and
        other signed routes), OWRD (locations of major bodies of water),
        and the Oregon office of BLM (the outline of Oregon).<br>
        <h3>How were these maps created?</h3>
        <p>I made these maps using the R programming language. <a href="school_performance_writeup.html">Click
          here</a> to read my writeup of the process. The writeup fully
          details how to obtain the raw data and includes complete,
          reusable source code for making other maps like these.<br>
        </p>

      <div align="left">
        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p>I created these because I wanted to see the geographic
          distribution of math &amp; ELA proficiency scores for Oregon's
          public schools. One way to do that would be to use the school
          district scores and the <a
            href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/Geographic/DistrictBoundaries">school

            district boundaries from the NCES</a>, but I wanted to do
          something to visualize the scores of individual schools.</p>
