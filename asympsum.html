Asymptotic bound for a particular sum</font><br style="font-family: Times New Roman;">

In <a href="http://qchu.wordpress.com/2010/02/08/optimizing-parameters/">a
post on his blog</a>, Qiaochu Yuan asks how fast the sequence
\[
R_n = \frac{n + \sqrt{n} + \sqrt[3]{n} + \cdots + \sqrt[n]{n}}{n}.
\]
converges to its limit. If you want to calculate this limit then
you should stop reading here. Anyhow, the limit is two, so if the
asymptotic behavior of
\[
S_n = R_n - 2 + \frac{1}{n} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k = 2}^{n}
\left(n^{1/k} - 1\right)
\]
is any slower than $O(1/n)$, then that behavior must belong to the
quantity $R_n - 2$.
<p>In Qiaochu's post he gives evidence for why he believes the
asymptotic behavior to be $O(1/\sqrt{n})$. We'll show that this
is indeed the case. To do this we'll need a small lemma.</p>

<div id="outer">
<div id="inner"><b>Lemma.</b>
The function
\[
\phi(x) = x^2 \left(e^{1/x} - 1\right) - \frac{x^2}{x+1}
\]
has the following properties:
<ul class="paren">
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"> (a)</span>
$\lim_{x \to 0^+} \phi(x) = \infty$, </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"> (b)</span>
$\lim_{x \to \infty} \phi(x) = 3/2$, </li>
  <li> <span style="font-weight: bold;">(c)</span>
There exists an $x_0 \in (0,\infty)$ such that $\phi$
is decreasing on $(0,x_0)$ and increasing on $(x_0,\infty)$
and $\phi(x_0) &lt; 3/2$. </li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<p style="text-align: center;">

A plot of $\phi(x)$ (in blue) and its horizontal asymptote $3/2$
(dashed and red).</p>

<p><b>Proof.</b> (a) This follows from the
application of
L'Hopital's Rule.
<br>
<br>
(b) We have
\[
\begin{align*}
\phi(1/x) &amp;= \frac{e^x - 1}{x^2} - \frac{1}{x(x+1)} \\
&amp;= \frac{x + \frac{x^2}{2} + O\left(x^3\right)}{x^2} -
\frac{1}{x}\left(1 - x + O\left(x^2\right)\right) \\
&amp;= \frac{3}{2} + O(x) \end{align*}
\]
as $x \to 0$, so
\[
\phi(x) = \frac{3}{2} + O\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)
\]
as $x \to \infty$.
<br>
<br>
(c) We will show that
\[
\phi'(x) = \frac{1}{(x+1)^2}\left(e^{1/x} (x + 1)^2 (2x - 1) - x
\left(2x^2 + 5x + 4\right)\right)
\]
has exactly one positive real zero. Hence we consider the function
\[
f(x) = (x+1)^2 \phi'(x) = e^{1/x} (x + 1)^2 (2x - 1) - x \left(2x^2 +
5x + 4\right).
\]
First, $f(1) &lt; 0 &lt; f(2)$, so $f(x)$ has a zero in the
interval $(1,2)$ with the desired sign change. The result will follow
if
\[
\tag{1}
f'(x) = (x + 1) \left(e^{1/x} \left(6x - 2 - \frac{1}{x} +
\frac{1}{x^2}\right) - 6x - 4\right) &gt; 0
\]
when $x &gt; 0$. Well, if we define
\[
g(x) = \frac{x^2 f'(1/x)}{x+1} = e^x \left(x^3 - x^2 - 2x + 6\right) -
4x - 6
\]
then $g(0) = 0$, so $(1)$ will follow if
\[
\tag{2}
g'(x) = e^x \left(x^3 + 2x^2 - 4x + 4\right)-4 &gt; 0
\]
when $x &gt; 0$. Since $g'(0) = 0$, we repeat the process once more
to calculate
\[
g''(x) = e^x x^2 (x + 5).
\]
Thus $g''(x) &gt; 0$ when $x &gt; 0$, giving inequality
$(2)$ which in turn implies inequality $(1)$.
<br>
<br>
In light of this conclusion, the facts $\phi(1) &lt; 3/2$
and $\phi'(1) &lt; 0$ imply that $\phi(x_0) &lt; 3/2$.</p>

<div align="right">
</div>

<p>The lemma tells us all we will need to know about $\phi$. In
particular, we can conclude that, if $\phi(r) &lt; 3/2$ for some
$r$, then $\phi(x) &lt; 3/2$ for all $x \geq r$. Therefore, we can
take $r$ small enough so that $\phi(x) \leq \phi(r)$ for $x \geq r$. We
can now derive the desired bound.</p>

<div id="outer">
<div id="inner"><b>Proposition.</b>
\[
S_n = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k = 2}^{n} \left(n^{1/k} - 1\right) = O
\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\right).
\]
</div>
</div>

<p>
<b>Proof.</b> By the lemma, $\phi(x) \leq \phi(2/\log n)$
for $x \geq 2/\log n$ when $n$ is large enough. Applying the map $x
\mapsto x/\log n$ renders the inequality
\[
n^{1/x} - 1 \leq \log n \left(\frac{\phi(2/\log n) \log n}{x^2} +
\frac{1}{x + \log n}\right)
\]
for $x \geq 2$.
<br>
<br>
The summand $n^{1/k} - 1$ is a decreasing function of $k$, so we
canwrite
\[
\begin{align*}
S_n &amp;\leq \frac{1}{n} \left(\sqrt{n} - 1 + \int_2^n
\left(n^{1/x} - 1\right) dx \right) \\
&amp;\leq \frac{1}{n} \left(\sqrt{n} - 1 + \int_2^n \log n
\left(\frac{\phi(2/\log n) \log n}{x^2} + \frac{1}{x + \log n}\right)
dx \right) \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{n} \left(\sqrt{n} - 1 + \frac{\phi(2/\log
n)(n-2)(\log n)^2}{2n} + \log n \log\left(\frac{n + \log n}{2 + \log
n}\right) \right).
\end{align*}
\]
(Justification for the first inequality can be found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_test_for_convergence#Proof">here</a>.)
Plugging
in the value of $\phi(2/\log n)$ we get
\[
\begin{split}
S_n &amp;\leq \frac{8 - 8\sqrt{n} - 6n + 6n^{3/2} + 8\log n -
4\sqrt{n}\log n - 5n\log n + 3n^{3/2}\log n}{n^2 (2 + \log n)} \\
&amp;\hspace{3in} + \frac{\log n \log\left(\frac{n + \log
n}{2 + \log n}\right)}{n}.
\end{split}
\]
The first term is $O \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\right)$, and, since
\[
\frac{\log n \log\left(\frac{n + \log n}{2 + \log
n}\right)}{\sqrt{n}} \to 0,
\]
so is the second.

<big><big>Some comments on approximating $e^{1/x}-1$</big></big><br>

<br>

The lemma tells us that, for $x$ large enough (e.g. for $x \geq
103/223$),
\[
\phi(x) &lt; 3/2,
\]
and so
\[
\tag{3}
e^{1/x} - 1 &lt; \frac{1}{x+1} + \frac{3}{2x^2}.
\]
Hence the coefficient on $1/x^2$ is significant geometrically; it
is the upper bound for $\phi$ on the interval in question.
Interestingly, it also plays an important analytical role. To see
this, let's take a step back and try "guessing" the above
relationship.
<br>

<br>

We want to approximate the function
\[
e^{1/x} - 1 = \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{2x^2} + \frac{1}{6x^3} + \cdots
\]
for $x$ large enough. And not only this; our purposes require that
the function we approximate it by have a known integral. Further,
we would like it to have the same behavior near infinity, so we
want it to be equal up to at least inverse-first order. If we
apply the map $x \mapsto 1/x$, our question becomes that of
approximating
\[
e^x - 1 = x + \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{6} + \cdots
\]
near the origin by some function equal to at least first order and
with a known integral (after transforming back).
<br>

<br>

Because every coefficient in the power series of the exponential
function is positive, we will always have
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{r} \frac{x^k}{k!} &lt; e^x - 1,
\]
so we'll need to look elsewhere if we want to bound our function
above. The function
\[
\frac{1}{1-x} = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + \cdots
\]
seems like a good candidate: we can simply multiply by $x$ to get
equality to first order and it certainly has a known integral after
the appropriate transformation. However, things blow up when $x$ is
near unity, and has the wrong sign when $x$ is larger. These clash
with properties of the exponential function we'd like to preserve.
Let's try
\[
\frac{1}{x+1} = 1 - x + x^2 - x^3 + \cdots.
\]
Multiplying this by $x$ we do indeed get equality up to first order
near zero, and its behavior elsewhere doesn't conflict nearly as badly
as the previous guess. Transforming back for a moment, we have
\[
e^{1/x} - 1 - \frac{1}{x+1} = \frac{c}{x^2} +
O\left(\frac{1}{x^3}\right)
\]
for some constant $c$, so that
\[
x^2\left(e^{1/x} - 1 - \frac{1}{x+1}\right) \to c
\]
as $x \to \infty$. The expression on the left is exactly $\phi(x)$,
so $c = 3/2$. Thus this choice of coefficient for $1/x^2$ in $(3)$
ensures equality up to inverse-second order near infinity. In general,
if we compute the difference
\[
\begin{align*}
e^x - 1 - \frac{x}{x+1} &amp;= \sum_{k = 2}^{\infty}
\left(\frac{1}{k!} + (-1)^k\right) x^k \\
&amp;= \frac{3}{2}x^2 - \frac{5}{6}x^3 + \frac{25}{24}x^4 + \cdots,
\end{align*}
\]
we may take as many terms as we like to get a better approximation of
the exponential function. However, it seems that we must take up to
and including an even power in order to get the correct inequality.<br>
